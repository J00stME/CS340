Creating a CRUD module was trivial because pymongo is very well documented.  All I needed to do was handle the user inputs properly for each operation

In future projects I will always appreciate the power of existing frameworks and how they can allow different codebases to interact with each other.  PyMongo, Pandas, and Dash all synergyze eloquently.

Computer scientists harness the powers of knowledge and interface with them in many different ways like so.

That is all.
